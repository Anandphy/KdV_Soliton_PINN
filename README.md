# Solitary Wave Solution in KdV Equation using PINN

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and obtain the solitary wave solution. PINNs combine neural networks with physical principles to efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
